unified is an interface for processing text with syntax trees and transforming between them.

## Core

The unified library itself is a small module.
It’s a rather small API.
Plugins do everything else: minify HTML, lint markdown, check indefinite
articles (“a”, “an”), and more.

Three syntaxes are connected to unified, each coming with a syntax tree
definition, and a parser and stringifier:
[mdast][] with [remark][] for markdown,
[nlcst][] with [retext][] for prose, and
[hast][] with [rehype][] for HTML.

unified defers part of its logic to [vfile][], which is a virtual file format
representing documents being processed, and [unist][], a schema for syntax
trees.

## Virtual files

[vfile][] stores metadata about documents being processed (often, but not
always, from the file system).
Mainly, it houses a path to files, and their contents.
Additionally, it tracks messages associated with files and where they occurred.
This powers code linting, such as with [`remark-cli`][remark-cli],
[`remark-validate-links`][remark-validate-links], and
[`remark-preset-lint-consistent`][remark-preset-lint-consistent].

## Syntax tree

[unist][] discloses documents as syntax trees.
Syntax trees come in two flavours: Concrete (CST) and Abstract (AST).
The first has all information needed to restore the original document
completely, the latter does not.
But, ASTs can recreate an exact syntactic representation.
For example, CSTs house info on style such as tabs or spaces, but ASTs do not.
This makes ASTs often easier to work with.
