# Collective

The current landscape of open source software seems to indicate that only big,
existing projects, with a giant direct user base, can be sustainable.
We believe that projects which are more low-level, like unified, and projects
which are new, like [micromark][], should also be sustainable.

To reach this goal, weâ€™re creating a collective of hundreds of projects,
spanning from low-level building blocks to high-level user-facing projects,
all sharing the same support pool.
