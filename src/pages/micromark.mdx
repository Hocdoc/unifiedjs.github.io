**micromark** is a low-level markdown parser in JavaScript.
In nerdy terms, it’s a lexer.

It’s a new project under the unified umbrella that’s smaller, faster, and
compliant to commonmark.
We’re building it to lay a better foundation for markdown parsers like
[remark][] build from the beginning to support extensions like [mdx][].
micromark is written in TypeScript so that it’s possible to compile it to WASM.

micromark will allow other projects to create a CST from markdown and will
provide a better base for remark.
